This is a template to how a Level should look like,
Name of the file = 'LevelX'   , where X is an id number of the level,

The file should contain:
a                                           - pathLength of the level (time it takes for an enemy to get to the other end)
b                                           - passive income of the level
d                                           - length of the enemy path
d1x d1y d2x d2y d3x d3y ...... ddx ddy      - coordinates of the next steps in the path
e                                           - tiles excluded from the game (scenery files)
e1x e1y e2x e2y                             - coordinates of excluded fields
c                                           - number of waves on this level
x1 c11 c12 c13 c14 c15 ......               - description of the n-th wave where x1 is the length of given wave , cij is the id of the enemy, 0 is null(empty space)
x2 c21 c22 c23 c24 c25 ......
